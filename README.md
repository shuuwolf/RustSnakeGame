# SNAKE GAME in RUST

The quite old and famous snake game that came by default on some cell phones back in the day.

## How to run

to run the game, just run the code below.

```bash
cargo run
```

## Credits

I did this game after seeing the tutorial a couple of times, On Youtube channel "Tensor Programming" to learn a little more of rust, Could learn a thing or two, even more thinking that i had a few errors to solve, for some packages(crates) outdated.

## License

My mind, if i have one :D
